Windows Virtual Desktop Migration for Azure 



							Take your desktop to the cloud for remote work and unparalleled productivity						











Desktop Virtualization
 



							The Next Leap Forward in Enterprise Productivity						



Virtual Desktop platforms are transforming how teams work from anywhere in the world– an necessity in a post-pandemic world. Desktop virtualization is also a critical tool for maintaining business continuity. If disaster strikes, organizations can rest assure that their data remains secure and accessible at the cloud, allowing business operations to resume immediately.Enter Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). WVD is a cloud-based application and desktop virtualization tool powered by Azure. Its baked-in security and compliance features, integration with the Microsoft suite of products enterprises have relied on for decades, and cost effectiveness makes it the best virtual desktop solution available. 







 











Desktop Virtualization Process 



							We understand that every organization has different goals for their WVD investment. Our team of Azure experts and cloud consultants provide a cost optimization, security, and remote productivity strategy tailored to your specific needs. The path to desktop virtualization includes four key phases						














 




						ASSESS					


						Create a desktop virtualization plan informed by your application needs, current licenses, and infrastructure and TCO goals

					













 




						DEPLOY					


						Set up a scalable & flexible virtualized environment tailored to your team’s productivity goals and remote work requirements.
					













 




						ONBOARD					


						Train employees on WVD best practices so that they can get the most out of their desktop virtualization investment.

					













 




						SECURE & MANAGE					


						Leverage advanced adaptive threat protection tools to keep your virtualized infrastructure’s data secure and stable.

					














Make the journey from ON-PREM VDI TO WVD
 



							Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is a key cog in the business continuity machinery, as it helps securely deliver desktops and applications to flexible workforces, regardless of their locations. By transitioning from on-premises VDI to Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) in Azure, you can realize better ROI from your deployment while making your business continuity efforts more cost-effective, reliable, and futureproof.

						



























Simplified Productivity 



Given that employees are 20-25% more productive when working from home (WFH), and 76% of them prefer working remotely, virtual desktops will be critical for companies looking to get the most out of their workforce.WVD provides a level of freedom and workplace efficiency that would have otherwise been impossible, enabling companies to fully embrace post-2020 world of remote working. Windows Virtual Desktop integrates with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, ensuring a seamless experience from any device, any location.When you work with a Partner like QDS, the productivity gains experienced through your WVD solution are amplified even further. We ensure your desktops are linked correctly, your applications provide a seamless experience, and your users are onboarded successfully. 







 



























 







Cut Licensing and Infrastructure Costs 



WVD is a free service for anyone with an existing Windows user or Microsoft 365 license. The only additional costs are cloud consumption, for which you only pay for what you use.Windows Virtual Desktop also enables companies to maximize their current infrastructure and investments with VMware Horizon Cloud and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop Service on Microsoft Azure. WVD integrates into both of these existing applications and desktop virtualization environments for those looking to maintain a hybrid cloud deployment. In addition, VMware and Citrix customers can deploy Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session on Azure VMs, enabling multiple concurrent usersAt QDS, we have every trick and tactic at our disposal for optimizing your WVD and Azure costs. From Azure Hybrid Cloud Benefits and price matching to reserved instances and containerization, our team of Azure Cloud experts will ensure you get as much value as possible from your Windows Virtual Desktop investment. 



























Automatic Security 



With Windows Virtual Desktop, concerns over ransomware, malware, and cyber-attacks are greatly reduced. This is because WVD creates an extra security layer that exists in Azure and does not rely on the device the employee is using – or how secure that device is.WVD is hosted in not just any cloud – it resides in Microsoft Azure, the leading cloud provider for enterprise security which gives access to a suite of comprehensive, easyto-use tools for maintaining your security posture. 







 



























 






 
Azure Active Directory Conditional Access to manage risks and apply the right access controls to users and devices



 
Azure Firewall and Azure Sentinel to keep virtual desktops secure and reduce vulnerabilities with end-to-end security



 
Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for secure login and easy threat detection using Azure Security Cent



 
Managing security in the cloud and adhering to Azure security best practices takes a particular skill set that many companies lack. For this reason, Partners like QDS can help you bridge the knowledge gap. Our experts understand every facet of Microsoft’s vast security toolset and will ensure your team knows how to leverage it to ensure end-to-end security for your virtual desktop implementation.
