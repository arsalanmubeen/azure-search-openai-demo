Aruba Networks Installs One of the Middle East’s Largest Wireless Networks for the Hospitality Industry at Ezdan Hotels West Bay in Qatar 











Enterprise-Class Wi-Fi Network Able to Support more than 32,000 Mobile Devices across 3,000 Guest Rooms and Hotel FacilitiesTuesday, October 28, 2014 5:00 am PDTDUBAI, United Arab EmiratesDUBAI, United Arab Emirates–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Aruba Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARUN) has successfully completed one of the Middle East’s largest wireless LAN projects in hospitality at the 3,000 room Ezdan Hotels West Bay in Qatar. In addition to enabling complimentary Wi-Fi services across the facility, the Aruba wireless overlay design dramatically cuts network cabling costs.“Today Wi-Fi is an essential technology to satisfy travellers who expect to stay connected at all times,” said Samer Habbouch, Territory Manager, Qatar at Aruba Networks. “Although most guests expect Wi-Fi to be a free service, they are quick to vocalize their dissatisfaction if the wireless quality is not up to mark. Aruba’s enterprise-class mobility solution has enabled Ezdan to provide its guests with hassle-free, secure and reliable Internet access.”According to Ezdan Hotels West Bay, the decision to select the Aruba wireless solution was based on the proactive support of Aruba Networks and its integration partner, Qatar Datamation Systems (QDS), and Aruba’s ability to centrally manage and automate labor-intensive tasks. This was particularly important given the large size of the property, which made manually configuring and maintaining Access Points (APs) a significant challenge.While the Hotel continued to operate at full capacity, QDS completed the deployment in just three months avoiding any inconvenience to guests. QDS installed Aruba wireless across the entire facility including guest rooms, banquet halls, parking, pool and additional guest areas. Each AP was strategically deployed to extend wireless coverage to more than one room, reducing the number of APs and installation time to reduce overall cost. The Hotel utilized Aruba Mobility Controllers giving its IT team the ability to manage secure authentication, encryption, VPN connections, IPv4 and IPv6 services, and wireless intrusion protection for more than 32,000 mobile devices simultaneously.With Aruba’s solution in place, Ezdan Hotels West Bay now has complete visibility and control of the network and devices on it from a single, easy-to-use interface. The Hotel’s IT Team has also added comprehensive real-time monitoring capabilities to streamline troubleshooting and remediation by implementing Aruba AirWave Network Management. According to Aruba, AirWave allows the Hotel to ‘identify and resolve problems in its wireless network before the issue results in helpdesk calls from guests’.“Aruba’s mobility solutions are centered around delivering enterprise-grade quality and performance in a cost-efficient package,” said Samer Habbouch. “This huge project at Ezdan Hotels West Bay is further validation of our capabilities to meet #GenMobile mobility needs in the hospitality sector. The new Aruba infrastructure not only supports complimentary Wi-Fi for guests but can also be leveraged as a platform to generate new revenue streams through premium service offerings.”Ezdan Hotels West Bay is a part of Ezdan Holding Group, which is featured among the world’s leading organizations in Forbes Magazine’s Global 2000 list. With the Hotel already reaping the benefits of Aruba’s wireless network, plans are underway to replicate this success in other companies that are a part of the Group.About Aruba Networks, Inc.Aruba Networks is a leading provider of next-generation network access solutions for the mobile enterprise. The company designs and delivers Mobility-Defined Networks that empower IT departments and #GenMobile, a new generation of tech-savvy users who rely on their mobile devices for every aspect of work and personal communication. To create a mobility experience that #GenMobile and IT can rely upon, Aruba Mobility-Defined Networks™ automate infrastructure-wide performance optimization and trigger security actions that used to require manual IT intervention. The results are dramatically improved productivity and lower operational costs.Listed on the NASDAQ and Russell 2000® Index, Aruba is based in Sunnyvale, California, and has operations throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions.

QDS has been appointed as ADR for Microsoft Windows Surface for Qatar 











 







Qatar Datamation Systems (QDS) says the key facts: global launch of the new Microsoft SurfacePro 2 tablet will enhance its ability to oﬀer end-to-end solutions in mobility and Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) functionality to address the productivity crisis in Qatar business.QDS today announced it has been appointed in a limited group of Authorised Device Resellers (ADR) providing the newly launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 tablets, which bridge the gap between consumer-style entertainment tablets and full-featured business laptops.The Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 quickly change from a tablet to laptop thanks to a two-position built-in kick-stand, multiple ports and click-on keyboard.A new optional accessory Surface Dock allows more device connections, while a Power Cover/Keyboard supplies extra battery power.The inclusion of more processing power and up to 8 hours of standard battery life means that Surface Pro 2 can deliver the full potential of the updated Windows 8.1 operating system.“Surface Pro 2 is the missing link which leverages the full vision of Windows 8 as a business productivity tool,” said QDS’s GM Mr. Mohammad Alam.“The new Surface will meet employee requirements for greater mobility while also enabling creative work practices. This is a major step up from consumer targeted consumption devices.”Mr. Mohammad Alam says Devices like the Surface deliver the human interface piece of the “Nexus of Forces” which Gartner Research has identiﬁed as deﬁning IT in the immediate future.Combined with the emergence of cloud computing and big data, demands for mobility and BYOD are rapidly changing the IT landscape.“Providing employees with more ﬂexible IT solutions is vital to raising productivity, retaining talented staﬀ and gaining a competitive edge,” said Mr. Alam.“Bringing Surface Pro 2 and Surface 2 to the Qatar commercial channel greatly extends the reach of our devices-and-services strategy, delivering our family of devices enabled by cloud services to more organisations than ever before.”Mohammad Alam says the trend toward employee mobility is growing as we transition from “time as an input” business models to “output” based models.“Businesses need to accommodate employees who want a mobile device that enables them to manage their business and social context whilst on the go.”“Enabling this while also keeping corporate systems and data secure unlocks greater productivity with the workforce and creates application development opportunities which can further enable mobile workforces.“The social behaviour of the IT user is now a major consideration and Surface Pro 2 can accommodate those trends.”

QDS won the Advance Weather Forecasting Project of Civil Aviation Authority Met Office 











 







The Qatar Civil Aviation Authority / Qatar Meteorology Department (QCAA/QMD) upgrades its weather forecasting capabilities by initiating a major new project. In an open tender where ten consortia from Europe, USA and Korea participated and presented very interesting solutions, the evaluation declared the informatics company Qatar Datamation Systems (QDS), in collaboration with the Greek partnership of Innovative Technology Center S.A. (ITC) and University of Athens (UOA), as the winner.The experience of an institute like University of Athens and its capability to provide high-level training to the QMD employees weighted heavily towards the final choice, alongside QDS’s reputation as a leading informatics company in Qatar and Gulf Region. The Greek partnership is well known for successfully carrying out similar projects in Greece, Europe, USA, as well as other parts of the world including the Arabian Peninsula and Gulf region. Over the past eight years, it steadily provides a series of sophisticated meteorological and environmental prediction tools for numerous applications in the Gulf region. These tools (models) are well-known for their efficient predictions of desert dust and associated phenomena and can accurately predict day-to-day and extreme weather events. The setup of such systems needs to take place in a supercomputing system that will be assembled by QDS and maintained by QMD.Well known forecasting tools like SKIRON/Dust and WRF will be installed and provide the regional forecasts. The high-resolution system RAMS/ICLAMS is expected to provide state-of-the-art predictions such as wind shear and fog for the new airport of Qatar, whereas wave and ocean forecasting systems (WAM and MICOM, respectively) will provide the necessary marine predictions. The forecasts will be available both to Qatar citizens as well as to the industry of the country. The new international airport of Doha and the flag carrier Qatar Airways, together with Qatar Gas and Qatar Petroleum that make up the heavy industry of the country, are expected to be substantially benefitted by the accurate weather and environmental predictions.The Director of QMD Mr Ahmed Abdulla declared to be very happy having this contract assigned to the specific consortium, because of the state-of-the-art forecasting tools implemented, the training activities and the transfer of expertise. According to him, this weather forecasting system is the first step towards a bigger activity related to marine and environmental forecasting, monitoring of the seismic activity and other major environmental issues of the region. Both Mr Abdulla and Professor Kallos stated that their target is to make QMD the leading institute in the Gulf Region, one that will coordinate meteorological and environmental predictions. It is worth mentioning that Qatar will host the Marine Center and related activities of World Meteorological Organization, under Regional Association II (Asia, Gulf Region, and Arabian Sea).Click here to read more from  http://www.raya.com/news/pages/c407b248-726f-4f45-9c79-d45b3185b5c5
